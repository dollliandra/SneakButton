#              About              #
#=================================#

A quick mod to repurpose the Crouch button and Sneaky perk into a proper sneak toggle.

To use the mod, learn the Sneaky upgrade, then click Crouch to start sneaking around.
* Rogue starts with Sneaky for free.
* There's also a Crouch keybind in settings.

#        Mod Configuration        #
#=================================#

Includes two optional settings in the MCM.

1.) Crouch Button passes turn.  (Default: ON)
* I wasn't sure whether or not this was ideal behavior, so you can choose.

2.) New Stealth Roll upgrade.  (Default: ON)
* Adds a new upgrade that lets you sprint while crouched, but with an extra +30 SP Cost.
